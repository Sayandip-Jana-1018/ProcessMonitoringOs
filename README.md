- Authors: Sayandip Jana, Mohit Kumar Mishra, Anurag Pandey

### 1. Project Overview
**Goals**:  
The goal is to transform your current task manager-like dashboard into an advanced, visually appealing, and innovative real-time process monitoring tool. It should not only display process states, CPU usage, and memory consumption but also empower administrators with efficient process management and proactive issue detection.

**Expected Outcomes**:  
- A sleek, modern, and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances user experience.  
- Real-time monitoring with enriched data visualization and actionable insights.  
- Innovative features like anomaly detection, historical trends, and enhanced process management capabilities.  

**Scope**:  
The project focuses on local system monitoring (with potential for remote monitoring later), targeting administrators who need to oversee and manage system processes efficiently. It includes UI enhancements, new functionalities, and modular code organization while maintaining performance.

### 2. Module-Wise Breakdown
To make the project manageable and scalable, divide it into three core modules:

#### GUI Module
- **Purpose**: Handles the user interface, displaying process information, controls, and system metrics in a visually appealing way.  
- **Role**: Acts as the front-facing layer, ensuring usability and interactivity for administrators.

#### Data Visualization Module
- **Purpose**: Generates and updates real-time graphs and charts to represent system and process metrics.  
- **Role**: Provides visual insights into resource usage trends and patterns, making data easier to interpret.

#### ML Module
- **Purpose**: Implements intelligent features like anomaly detection or resource usage forecasting.  
- **Role**: Adds a proactive layer to identify potential issues before they escalate, enhancing the dashboard’s utility.

### 3. Functionalities
Here are key features for each module, with examples to illustrate their implementation:

#### GUI Module
- **Process List Display with Filtering and Sorting**:  
  Show a table of processes with columns like PID, Name, CPU%, Memory, etc., sortable by clicking column headers. Add a search bar to filter by name or user.  
  *Example*: Clicking "CPU%" sorts processes by descending CPU usage; typing "python" filters to Python processes.  
- **Context Menus**:  
  Right-click a process to access options like "Kill," "Change Priority," or "View Details."  
  *Example*: Right-clicking a process opens a menu with "Kill Process" and "Set Priority to High."  
- **Process Details Pane**:  
  Selecting a process shows detailed info (e.g., command line, start time) in a side panel.  
  *Example*: Clicking PID 1234 displays its full command line and thread count.  
- **Notification Area**:  
  Display alerts (e.g., high CPU usage) subtly within the UI instead of pop-ups.  
  *Example*: A red banner at the bottom says, "CPU at 85% - Check Process XYZ."  

#### Data Visualization Module
- **Real-Time Graphs**:  
  Plot CPU and memory usage over time with smooth updates. Add per-core CPU usage or memory breakdown.  
  *Example*: Two line graphs show total CPU% (red) and memory% (blue), updating every 2 seconds.  
- **Top Resource Consumers Bar Chart**:  
  Display a dynamic bar chart of the top 5 CPU or memory-intensive processes.  
  *Example*: Horizontal bars show "chrome.exe" at 40% CPU, "python.exe" at 25%, etc.  
- **Historical Data Visualization**:  
  Store and display usage trends for selected processes over time.  
  *Example*: A graph shows "notepad.exe" CPU usage for the last 10 minutes.  

#### ML Module
- **Anomaly Detection**:  
  Flag processes with unusual resource usage based on statistical thresholds (e.g., z-scores).  
  *Example*: "firefox.exe" using 90% CPU (3 standard deviations above average) gets highlighted in red.  
- **Resource Usage Forecasting**:  
  Predict future CPU/memory usage for "watched" processes using simple models like moving averages.  
  *Example*: A graph shows "java.exe" predicted to hit 80% memory in 5 minutes.  
- **Alert Generation**:  
  Trigger notifications when anomalies or forecasts exceed user-defined thresholds.  
  *Example*: "Warning: Process XYZ memory usage trending high - forecasted at 90%."

### 4. Technology Recommendations
Given your current Python-based implementation, here’s a tailored tech stack:

- **Programming Language**:  
  - **Python**: Stick with Python for consistency and its rich ecosystem of libraries.  

- **Libraries and Tools**:  
  - **GUI**:  
    - **Tkinter with ttk**: Use themed widgets (`ttk`) for a modern look. Consider `ttkbootstrap` for Bootstrap-inspired styles or explore **PyQt/PySide** for more advanced UI capabilities.  
  - **Data Visualization**:  
    - **Matplotlib**: Continue using it for real-time plots, enhanced with `seaborn` for better aesthetics. Alternatively, **Plotly** offers interactive plots embeddable in Tkinter.  
  - **ML**:  
    - **NumPy**: For statistical anomaly detection (e.g., mean, standard deviation).  
    - **Scikit-learn**: For lightweight ML models like Isolation Forest (optional).  
  - **Data Collection**:  
    - **psutil**: Already in use—perfect for process and system metrics.  
  - **Storage (Optional)**:  
    - **Collections.deque**: For in-memory rolling windows of historical data.  
    - **SQLite**: If persistent storage is needed later (e.g., for snapshots).  

- **Additional Tools**:  
  - **Threading**: Use Python’s `threading` module (as in your code) for non-blocking updates.  
  - **Pillow**: For adding icons or images to buttons in Tkinter.

### 5. Execution Plan
Here’s a step-by-step guide to implement the enhancements efficiently:

#### Step 1: Modernize the GUI
- **Reorganize Layout**:  
  - Use a grid layout with `ttk.Frame`:  
    - Top: Toolbar (search bar, action buttons with icons).  
    - Middle: Process list (`ttk.Treeview`).  
    - Bottom: Graphs and notification area.  
  - *Tip*: Use `grid()` instead of `pack()` for precise control.  
- **Apply Modern Styling**:  
  - Integrate `ttkbootstrap` or a custom theme (e.g., "azure").  
  - Add icons to buttons using `PIL` (e.g., trash icon for "Kill").  
  - Use a dark theme with accent colors (e.g., gray background, red for alerts).  
- **Enhance Interactivity**:  
  - Add sorting to `Treeview` columns (e.g., `tree.heading("CPU%", command=sort_by_cpu)`).  
  - Implement context menus with `tk.Menu`.  
  - Create a details pane with `ttk.LabelFrame`.  

#### Step 2: Improve Data Visualization
- **Enhance Graphs**:  
  - Add subplots for per-core CPU usage or memory breakdown in `matplotlib`.  
  - Use `plt.style.use('seaborn-darkgrid')` for a modern look.  
- **Add Top Consumers Chart**:  
  - Create a bar chart updating every 5 seconds with top 5 processes by CPU/memory.  
  - *Tip*: Use a separate `FigureCanvasTkAgg` instance.  
- **Enable Historical Data**:  
  - Store data in a `deque` (e.g., last 10 minutes, 200 points).  
  - Plot historical trends for selected processes on click.  

#### Step 3: Implement Innovative Features
- **Historical Data Tracking**:  
  - Modify `get_processes()` to append data to a dictionary of `deque` objects per PID.  
  - Display trends in a new graph when a process is selected.  
- **Anomaly Detection**:  
  - Calculate rolling mean and standard deviation for CPU/memory per process.  
  - Highlight processes exceeding 3 standard deviations in the `Treeview` with tags (e.g., `tree.tag_configure('anomaly', background='yellow')`).  
- **Notifications**:  
  - Replace `messagebox` alerts with a `ttk.Label` in a notification frame that updates dynamically.  

#### Step 4: Optimize Performance
- **Efficient Updates**:  
  - Update only changed rows in `Treeview` instead of clearing and repopulating.  
  - Use `after()` with adjustable intervals (e.g., 2-5 seconds) based on system load.  
- **Threading**:  
  - Keep graph updates in a separate thread (as you’ve done).  
  - Add a "Pause" button to stop updates temporarily.  

#### Step 5: Test and Refine
- **Testing**:  
  - Simulate high CPU/memory usage (e.g., run a stress test) to verify alerts and visuals.  
- **User Feedback**:  
  - Adjust UI elements (e.g., font size, colors) based on usability feedback.  
- **Documentation**:  
  - Add tooltips or a help section explaining features.

### Suggested Code Changes
Here’s how to apply some of these ideas to your existing code:

#### Modern UI with ttkbootstrap
```python
import ttkbootstrap as ttk
from ttkbootstrap.constants import *

root = ttk.Window(themename="darkly")  # Modern dark theme
root.title("Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard")
root.geometry("900x600")

tree = ttk.Treeview(root, columns=columns, show="headings", style="primary.Treeview")
# ... rest of your Treeview setup ...

kill_btn = ttk.Button(btn_frame, text="Kill Process", command=kill_process, style="danger.TButton")
```

#### Historical Data Tracking
```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

process_history = defaultdict(lambda: {'cpu': deque(maxlen=200), 'mem': deque(maxlen=200)})

def get_processes():
    process_list = []
    for proc in psutil.process_iter(attrs=['pid', 'name', 'cpu_percent', 'memory_info']):
        info = proc.info
        info['memory_info'] = info['memory_info'].rss // 1024**2
        process_list.append(info)
        process_history[info['pid']]['cpu'].append(info['cpu_percent'])
        process_history[info['pid']]['mem'].append(info['memory_info'])
    return process_list
```

#### Anomaly Detection
```python
import numpy as np

def check_anomalies():
    for pid, data in process_history.items():
        cpu_data = list(data['cpu'])
        if len(cpu_data) > 10:  # Enough data points
            mean, std = np.mean(cpu_data), np.std(cpu_data)
            if cpu_data[-1] > mean + 3 * std:
                tree.tag_configure('anomaly', background='yellow')
                tree.item(tree.get_children()[pid_index], tags='anomaly')
    root.after(5000, check_anomalies)
```

### Innovative Enhancements
Beyond the basics, consider these innovative additions:
- **Process Grouping**: Group processes by application or user in the `Treeview` for better organization.  
- **Snapshot Feature**: Save current process states to a CSV file for later comparison.  
- **Remote Monitoring (Future)**: Use `paramiko` for SSH to monitor remote machines.  
- **Predictive Alerts**: Forecast system overload based on trends and alert administrators.
