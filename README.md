## 1. Project Overview
The Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard is an advanced system monitoring tool designed to provide administrators with comprehensive insights into system performance and process management. The application transforms the traditional task manager concept into a feature-rich, visually appealing dashboard that offers real-time monitoring, data visualization, and intelligent process management capabilities.

**Goals:**  
- Create an advanced, visually appealing, and innovative real-time process monitoring tool
- Display detailed process states, CPU usage, and memory consumption in an intuitive interface
- Empower administrators with efficient process management and proactive issue detection capabilities

**Expected Outcomes:**  
- A sleek, modern, and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances user experience
- Real-time monitoring with enriched data visualization and actionable insights
- Innovative features like anomaly detection, historical trends, and enhanced process management capabilities

  - Selecting a process shows detailed information in a side panel
  - Displays comprehensive process attributes including command line, start time, threads, and priority
  - Example: Clicking PID 1234 displays its full command line, creation time, and thread count

- **Notification Area:**
  - Displays system alerts and anomaly notifications within the UI
  - Provides actionable insights based on system state
  - Example: A notification appears when CPU usage exceeds 85%, highlighting the responsible process

### Data Visualization Module
- **Real-Time Performance Graphs:**
  - Plots CPU, memory, and disk usage over time with smooth updates
  - Visually appealing graphs with color-coded lines and area fills
  - Example: Three line graphs show total CPU% (red), memory% (purple), and disk% (yellow), updating every second

- **Top Resource Consumers Visualization:**
  - Displays the most resource-intensive processes
  - Provides visual indicators for processes consuming excessive resources
  - Example: Processes using high CPU or memory are highlighted in the process list

- **Historical Data Visualization:**
  - Stores and displays usage trends over time
  - Enables analysis of system performance patterns
  - Example: Graphs show system resource usage for the past monitoring session

### ML Module
- **Anomaly Detection:**
  - Flags processes with unusual resource usage based on statistical models
  - Uses Isolation Forest algorithm to identify outliers in resource consumption
  - Example: A process suddenly consuming 90% CPU (significantly above its normal pattern) gets highlighted as an anomaly

- **Resource Usage Forecasting:**
  - Predicts future CPU/memory usage using ARIMA time-series models
  - Provides short-term forecasts of system resource trends
  - Example: The dashboard shows predicted CPU and memory usage for the next 5 minutes

- **Intelligent Alert Generation:**
  - Triggers notifications based on anomaly detection and forecasting
  - Provides context-aware alerts with actionable information

## Appendix

### A. AI-Generated Project Elaboration/Breakdown Report
The Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard project represents a significant advancement in system monitoring tools, combining traditional process management with modern data visualization and machine learning capabilities. The modular architecture ensures maintainability and extensibility, while the intuitive user interface provides administrators with comprehensive insights into system performance.

The project successfully implements:
- Real-time monitoring of system resources and processes
- Visual representation of performance metrics through interactive graphs
- Intelligent anomaly detection using machine learning algorithms
- Predictive analytics for resource usage forecasting
- Efficient process management capabilities

These features collectively transform system monitoring from a reactive to a proactive approach, enabling administrators to identify and address potential issues before they impact system performance.

### B. Problem Statement
Traditional task managers and system monitoring tools often provide basic information without advanced visualization, predictive capabilities, or user-friendly interfaces. Administrators need more comprehensive tools that not only display current system state but also provide insights, detect anomalies, and forecast potential issues. The Real-Time Process Monitoring Dashboard addresses these limitations by combining modern UI design, data visualization, and machine learning to create an advanced monitoring solution.

### C. Solution/Code
Here are key code snippets from the implementation:

**1. Process Monitoring (process_utils.py):**
```python
def get_process_details(pid):
    """Get detailed information about a process"""
    try:
        process = psutil.Process(pid)
        
        # Get detailed information
        details = {
            "PID": pid,
            "Name": process.name(),
            "Status": process.status(),
            "Created": datetime.fromtimestamp(process.create_time()).strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'),
            "CPU %": f"{process.cpu_percent():.1f}%",
            "Memory": f"{process.memory_info().rss / (1024 * 1024):.1f} MB",
            "Username": process.username(),
            "Executable": process.exe(),
            "Command Line": " ".join(process.cmdline()),
            "Threads": process.num_threads(),
            "Priority": process.nice()
        }
        
        return details
    except (psutil.NoSuchProcess, psutil.AccessDenied):
        return None
```

        self.is_trained = False
        
    def train(self, cpu_data, mem_data, disk_data):
        """Train the anomaly detection model"""
        if len(cpu_data) < self.min_samples_for_training:
            return False
            
        try:
            # Combine the data into a single feature matrix
            X = np.column_stack((cpu_data, mem_data, disk_data))
            
            # Train an Isolation Forest model
            self.model = IsolationForest(contamination=0.05, random_state=42)

        """Predict the next values using ARIMA model"""
        if len(data) < self.min_samples_for_prediction:
            return None
            
        try:
            # Use a simple ARIMA model for prediction
            model = ARIMA(data, order=(1, 0, 0))
            model_fit = model.fit()
            forecast = model_fit.forecast(steps=steps)
            return forecast
        except Exception as e:

            return None
```

    plt.subplots_adjust(hspace=0.3)
    
    # Configure each subplot
    for i, ax in enumerate(axes):

        ax.grid(True, linestyle='--', alpha=0.6, color='#3a3c60')  # Subtle grid lines
        ax.tick_params(colors='#c5cde6', labelsize=8)  # Light text for visibility
        
        # Set titles with improved visibility
        if i == 0:
            ax.set_title("CPU Usage (%)", color='#c5cde6', fontsize=10, pad=10)
        elif i == 1:
